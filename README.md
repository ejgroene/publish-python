# Publish Python
Separate publishing code to keep projects tidy.

Many projects' code bases are poluted by files for describing packaging, publishing, development environments and what not. These are not only orthogonal aspects, they are also quite in flux and, last but not least, have their own lifecycle.

This repository is an approach to get the packaging and publishing out.

It contains generic stuff, and project specific code if needed.
